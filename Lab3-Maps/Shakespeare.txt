A most notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly promise breaker, the owner of no one good quality. Away, you starvelling, you elf-skin, you dried neat’s-tongue, bull’s-pizzle, you stock-fish!
Away, you three-inch fool! Come, come, you froward and unable worms! Go, prick thy face, and over-red thy fear, Thou lily-liver’d boy. His wit’s as thick as a Tewkesbury mustard.
You are pigeon-liver’d and lack gall. I am sick when I do look on thee. I must tell you friendly in your ear, sell when you can, you are not for all markets.
If thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them. I’ll beat thee, but I would infect my hands.
Methink’st thou art a general offence and every man should beat thee. More of your conversation would infect my brain.
